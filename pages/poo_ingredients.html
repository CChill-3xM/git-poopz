<h1>YUCK! But what is poop made of?</h1>

<p>Poop is mostly water, plus a mix of bacteria, undigested food (especially fiber), dead cells, and small amounts of fats, proteins, and waste products.  
It’s surprisingly complex — and honestly, kind of fascinating once you get past the “yuck” factor.</p>

<h2>💩 What Poop Is Made Of (Scientifically)</h2>

<h3>💦 About 75% Water</h3>
<p>Most stool is water, which keeps it soft enough to pass comfortably. (snuggymom.com)</p>

<h3>🦠 Bacteria (Living & Dead)</h3>
<p>Roughly 30% of the solid portion is bacteria — both the ones that helped digest your food and the ones that died along the way. (biologyinsights.com)</p>

<h3>🌱 Undigested Food & Fiber</h3>
<p>Another 30% is indigestible plant material like cellulose and other fibers your body can’t break down. (biologyinsights.com)</p>

<h3>🧫 Dead Cells & Mucus</h3>
<p>Your intestines constantly shed cells, and those end up in stool along with mucus from the gut lining. (Wikipedia)</p>

<h3>🧈 Fats & Proteins</h3>
<p>Small amounts of fats (10–20%) and proteins (2–3%) are part of the solid content. (biologyinsights.com) </p>

<h3>🎨 Pigments (Like Bilirubin)</h3>
<p>Bile pigments altered by bacteria give poop its classic brown color. (Wikipedia)</p>
