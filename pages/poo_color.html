<h1>🌈 The Goofy Guide to Poop Colors 🌈</h1>

<h2>🍫 Brown — “The Classic”</h2>
<p>The SCIENTIFIC why: Your body mixes food + bile + gut chemistry into this signature shade.</p>
<p>The ALTERNATIVE take: The default factory setting. The “original flavor” of poop.</p>

<h2>🥬 Green — “The Salad Escapee”</h2>
<p>The SCIENTIFIC why: Eating lots of greens, food coloring, or poop moving too fast through the gut so bile doesn’t break down fully.</p>
<p>The ALTERNATIVE take:  Your spinach staged a jailbreak and made it all the way to the finish line.</p>

<h2>🍌 Yellow — “The Butterball”</h2>
<p>The SCIENTIFIC why: Fat malabsorption or too much fat in the diet can make stool yellow and greasy.</p>
<p>The ALTERNATIVE take: Your poop tried to cosplay as a stick of margarine.</p>

<h2>🩸 Red — “The Drama Queen”</h2>
<p>The SCIENTIFIC why: Often from foods like beets or red dye, but can also be from bleeding lower in the digestive tract.</p>
<p>The ALTERNATIVE take: Your poop is trying to get attention again. Check your beet intake before panicking.</p>

<h2>🖤 Black — “The Goth Phase”</h2>
<p>The SCIENTIFIC why: Iron supplements, bismuth (like Pepto-Bismol), or bleeding higher in the digestive tract.</p>
<p>The ALTERNATIVE take: Your poop is listening to emo music and writing poetry.</p>

<h2>⚪ White / Clay — “The Ghost Poop”</h2>
<p>The SCIENTIFIC why: Lack of bile, often from a bile duct issue or certain medications.</p>
<p>The ALTERNATIVE take: Your poop has transcended this earthly realm and become a spirit orb.</p>

<h2>🟧 Orange — “The Carrot King”</h2>
<p>The SCIENTIFIC why: Eating lots of carrots, sweet potatoes, or orange food dyes.</p>
<p>The ALTERNATIVE take: Your poop is auditioning to be the new mascot for a pumpkin patch.</p>

<h2>🟦 Blue — “The Birthday Cake Special”</h2>
<p>The SCIENTIFIC why: Blue food dye (especially from frosting) can turn poop blue or greenish.</p>
